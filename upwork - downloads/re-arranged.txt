           1   Q.  Les, good afternoon. Doctor, could you please 

           2   state your name and business address? 

           3   A.  Yeah, my name is Leslie Scott Matthews and my 

           4   business address is Department of orthopedic surgery 

           5   at MedStar Union Memorial Hospital at 3333, North 

           6   Calvert Street in Baltimore. 

           7   Q.  Doctor, the reason that I've asked you to appear 

           8   here today for your deposition is because the case 

           9   that I represent Kevin Tolson with is pending in the 

          10   circuit court for Baltimore City. The defendants have 

          11   identified you as an expert. They may testify at 

          12   trial, and I'm here to find out all the opinions that 

          13   you intend to give in this case and all the factual 

          14   basis for your opinions. And I presume you've had 

          15   your deposition taken before I have okay. If at any 

          16   time that I ask you a question that you don't 

          17   understand, just stop me and ask me to rephrase the 

          18   question. Otherwise, if you don't, we'll assume that 

          19   you've understood the question and you've answered 

          20   accordingly. Also, if any time you need to take a 

          21   break, just let us know and we'll stop the 

          22   deposition. 

          23   A.  Thank you, doctor. 

          24   Q.  I want to show you what's been marked as exhibit 

          25   number one. I number one. This is the notice that I 

                                                         2


           1   sent to defense counsel noting your deposition today. 

           2   Part of that notice contains a list of documents and 

           3   items that we asked you to bring with you today. Do 

           4   you have can you tell me what you brought with you 

           5   today? In response to the deposition notice. 

           6   A.  Yes, I have brought a copy of my curriculum vitae 

           7   and all of the medical records and deposition 

           8   testimony that pertains to this case that I've 

           9   reviewed. 

          10   Q.  Okay, can you, can you quickly go through and 

          11   just identify each of the items that you have in 

          12   front of you that you brought with you today 

          13   A.  will do my best. I guess it's better to begin 

          14   here I have a compilation of files which include the 

          15   medical records pertaining to Mr. Tolson's care. That 

          16   include records from his initial visit to st Agnes on 

          17   12, 309, his follow up visit to st Agnes on 12 509 

          18   and his subsequent care at the University of 

          19   Maryland, which began, I believe, on 12 809 so that's 

          20   a good portion of these records. I also have a 

          21   significant number of transcripts of depositions 

          22   given in this case, including and in no particular 

          23   order, Caroline Stell, Krupa Shaw, Prudence Jackson, 

          24   Dr David shank, Dr Timothy, Besant i Dr William 

          25   Woodruff, Dr Paul Collier I uh Jeffrey Nicholson's

           1   deposition, who is a PA Sharon Craddock, RN Corey, 

           2   Elaine Tolson, Dr sarkar's deposition, Dr Malik's 

           3   deposition, two volumes of depositions from Linda 

           4   margusson. RN, a deposition transcript of Gregory 

           5   Sachs. CPO, a deposition of Kenneth Larson. MD, in 

           6   addition, I have some CDs which represent the imaging 

           7   studies that were done both at Mr. Colson's initial 

           8   presentation to st Agnes on 12 three and subsequently 

           9   on his follow up there on 12 five, I also have two 

          10   DVDs of animations that were prepared for this case 

          11   that depict, or attempt to depict, his injury and 

          12   mechanism of injury as I understand it. And then 

          13   finally, there are just some correspondences that 

          14   have taken place between myself and the other 

          15   attorneys in this case. Unknown Speaker Is, do you 

          16   have the correspondence pulled out? 

          17   A.  Well, it's here. Yes, it's sort of intermingled, 

          18   but I'll 

          19   Q.  just ask if at the end of the deposition, we can 

          20   pull them out and then I can mark them as an exhibit. 

          21   But we don't have to do that right now. We can 

          22   A.  do whatever is best for you. Okay, I believe that 

          23   covers everything. 

          24   Q.  Doctor Did you. I didn't hear you say that you 

          25   reviewed an MRI study that was taken at university.

           1   University of Maryland hospital on December the 

           2   ninth. Do you know, if you review, I 

           3   A.  certainly saw a written report describing the 

           4   findings. I can't recall. Quite honestly, I've 

           5   actually saw the images or not. 

           6   Q.  Okay. Did you need to see the actual images for 

           7   any of the opinions that you intend to give in this 

           8   case, or did you rely upon the written report itself 

           9   that 

          10   A.  had no not seeing the images when I have any 

          11   bearing on many of my opinions, I don't believe okay. 

          12   

          13   Q.  And did you prepare any notes? I did not. And 

          14   have you made any notations in any of the records 

          15   that are that you brought with you today. I have not 

          16   okay, and Doctor, can you tell me when you were first 

          17   contacted to serve as an expert witness in this case? 

          18   

          19   A.  Roughly sometime before the first of the year, I 

          20   think in the month of December of 2013 

          21   Q.  if I'm not mistaken, and which attorney contacted 

          22   you, I believe 

          23   A.  Miss Dinsmore, okay. 

          24   Q.  Have you worked for MS Dinsmore or her firm 

          25   before? 

                                                         5


           1   A.  Not that I not with MS Dinsmore that I can 

           2   recall, and I don't believe with her from 

           3   Q.  okay. Do you know how MS Dinsmore knew about you 

           4   or I got Okay, all right. And doctor, you're serving 

           5   today as an expert witness in a medical malpractice 

           6   case. Have you ever served as an expert witness in a 

           7   medical malpractice case before this case? I have. 

           8   And can you tell me when you first started reviewing 

           9   cases with an eye towards serving as an expert 

          10   witness in medical malpractice matters? 

          11   A.  I probably performed some sort of medical 

          12   malpractice review or expert testimony over a period 

          13   of at least 20 years. 20 years, yes, 

          14   Q.  has it always been in the area of orthopedic 

          15   surgery? It has. Do you hold yourself out as an 

          16   expert in vascular surgery? I do not. Okay. And can 

          17   you tell me, over the 20 years or so, how many times 

          18   you've actually testified in court, either by 

          19   videotape, deposition or in person? 

          20   A.  Probably not more than four or five. Were they 

          21   Q.  in the state of Maryland, or were they? Were they 

          22   all in the state of Maryland? 

          23   A.  There was a case that I recall that took place in 

          24   the state of Florida, and I was asked to give video 

          25   testimony for that case, for the proceedings in 

                                                         6


           1   Florida. That's the only one I can think of that was 

           2   out 

           3   Q.  of state. And over the 20 years, can you tell me 

           4   the breakdown percentage of cases where you reviewed 

           5   for the doctors and medical providers versus the 

           6   injured patient, 

           7   A.  both reviewed and Ultimately testified is by vast 

           8   majority for defense 

           9   Q.  is more than 75% probably 85% 

          10   A.  I don't know. I mean 80% 85% 

          11   Q.  and has that been, is that percentage stayed the 

          12   same over the last 20 years, approximately? 

          13   A.  Yeah, the reality situation is I, for some 

          14   reason, I don't get asked to look at anything but 

          15   defense work, so I don't get any plaintiff's work 

          16   that come to my way, so it's just the way it is. 

          17   Q.  And when's the last time you testified in court? 

          18   If you can recall 

          19   A.  in court several years ago, I can't be more 

          20   precise. 

          21   Q.  And of the four times that you've testified in 

          22   court as an expert in medical malpractice cases. Do 

          23   you recall the nature of the case and the opinion 

          24   that you provided? 

          25   A.  In general terms the last, the last case that I 

                                                         7


           1   can recall testifying in court was pertaining to a 

           2   alleged malpractice occurrence involved in a vascular 

           3   injury in the knee area following Surgery. Do you 

           4   Q.  remember any of the other ones? I 

           5   A.  there was, there was another case that went to 

           6   court. This goes back quite a few years. Similar 

           7   scenario. This was a vascular injury in the knee area 

           8   following arthroscopic surgery. Could not tell you 

           9   the exact time or certainly not the names. There was 

          10   a plaintiff's case that I became involved in that I 

          11   testified in court on behalf of the plaintiff quite a 

          12   few years ago that had to do with a with a foot 

          13   injury.
