      THIS IS WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE AFTER DELETING    1


           1   Q.  Les, good afternoon. Doctor, could you please

           2   state your name and business address?

           3   A.  Yeah, my name is Leslie Scott Matthews and my

           4   business address is Department of orthopedic surgery

           5   at MedStar Union Memorial Hospital at 3333, North

           6   Calvert Street in Baltimore.

           7   Q.  Doctor, the reason that I've asked you to appear

           8   here today for your deposition is because the case

           9   that I represent Kevin Tolson with is pending in the

          10   circuit court for Baltimore City. The defendants

          11   have identified you as an expert. They may testify

          12   at trial, and I'm here to find out all the opinions

          13   that you intend to give in this case and all the

          14   factual basis for your opinions. And I presume

          15   you've had your deposition taken before I have okay.

          16   If at any time that I ask you a question that you

          17   don't understand, just stop me and ask me to

          18   rephrase the question. Otherwise, if you don't,

          19   we'll assume that you've understood the question and

          20   you've answered accordingly. Also, if any time you

          21   need to take a break, just let us know and we'll

          22   stop the deposition.

          23   A.  Thank you, doctor.

          24   Q.  I want to show you what's been marked as exhibit

          25   number one. I number one. This is the notice that I

           1   sent to defense counsel noting your deposition

           2   today. Part of that notice contains a list of

           3   documents and items that we asked you to bring with

           4   you today. Do you have can you tell me what you

           5   brought with you today? In response to the

           6   deposition notice.

           7   A.  Yes, I have brought a copy of my curriculum

           8   vitae and all of the medical records and deposition

           9   testimony that pertains to this case that I've

          10   reviewed.

          11   Q.  Okay, can you, can you quickly go through and

          12   just identify each of the items that you have in

          13   front of you that you brought with you today

          14   A.  will do my best. I guess it's better to begin

          15   here I have a compilation of files which include the

          16   medical records pertaining to Mr. Tolson's care.

          17   That include records from his initial visit to st

          18   Agnes on 12, 309, his follow up visit to st Agnes on

          19   12 509 and his subsequent care at the University of

          20   Maryland, which began, I believe, on 12 809 so

          21   that's a good portion of these records. I also have

          22   a significant number of transcripts of depositions

          23   given in this case, including and in no particular

          24   order, Caroline Stell, Krupa Shaw, Prudence Jackson,

          25   Dr David shank, Dr Timothy, Besant i Dr William

           3   Elaine Tolson, Dr sarkar's deposition, Dr Malik's

           4   deposition, two volumes of depositions from Linda

           6   Sachs. CPO, a deposition of Kenneth Larson. MD, in

           7   addition, I have some CDs which represent the

           8   imaging studies that were done both at Mr. Colson's

           9   initial presentation to st Agnes on 12 three and

          10   subsequently on his follow up there on 12 five, I

          11   also have two DVDs of animations that were prepared

          12   for this case that depict, or attempt to depict, his

          13   injury and mechanism of injury as I understand it.

          14   And then finally, there are just some

          15   correspondences that have taken place between myself

          16   and the other attorneys in this case.

          17   Q.    Is, do you have the correspondence pulled out?

          18   A.    Well, it's here. Yes, it's sort of

          19   intermingled, but I'll

          20   Q.  just ask if at the end of the deposition, we can

          21   pull them out and then I can mark them as an

          22   exhibit. But we don't have to do that right now. We

          23   can

          24   A.  do whatever is best for you. Okay, I believe

          25   that covers everything.

           1   Q.  Doctor Did you. I didn't hear you say that you

           2   reviewed an MRI study that was taken at university.

           3   University of Maryland hospital on December the

           4   ninth. Do you know, if you review, I

           5   A.  certainly saw a written report describing the

           6   findings. I can't recall. Quite honestly, I've

           7   actually saw the images or not.

           8   Q.  Okay. Did you need to see the actual images for

           9   any of the opinions that you intend to give in this

          10   case, or did you rely upon the written report itself

          11   that

          12   A.  had no not seeing the images when I have any

          13   bearing on many of my opinions, I don't believe

          14   okay.

          15   Q.  And did you prepare any notes? I did not. And

          16   have you made any notations in any of the records

          17   that are that you brought with you today. I have not

          18   okay, and Doctor, can you tell me when you were

          19   first contacted to serve as an expert witness in

          20   this case?

          21   A.  Roughly sometime before the first of the year, I

          22   think in the month of December of 2013

          23   Q.  if I'm not mistaken, and which attorney

          24   contacted you, I believe

          25   A.  Miss Dinsmore, okay.

                                                       5



           1   Q.  Have you worked for MS Dinsmore or her firm

           2   before?

           3   A.  Not that I not with MS Dinsmore that I can

           4   recall, and I don't believe with her from

           5   Q.  okay. Do you know how MS Dinsmore knew about you

           6   or I got Okay, all right. And doctor, you're serving

           7   today as an expert witness in a medical malpractice

           8   case. Have you ever served as an expert witness in a

           9   medical malpractice case before this case? I have.

          10   And can you tell me when you first started reviewing

          11   cases with an eye towards serving as an expert

          12   witness in medical malpractice matters?

          13   A.  I probably performed some sort of medical

          14   malpractice review or expert testimony over a period

          15   of at least 20 years. 20 years, yes,

          16   Q.  has it always been in the area of orthopedic

          17   surgery? It has. Do you hold yourself out as an

          18   expert in vascular surgery? I do not. Okay. And can

          19   you tell me, over the 20 years or so, how many times

          20   you've actually testified in court, either by

          21   videotape, deposition or in person?

          22   A.  Probably not more than four or five. Were they

          23   Q.  in the state of Maryland, or were they? Were

          24   they all in the state of Maryland?

          25   A.  There was a case that I recall that took place

                                                       6



           1   in the state of Florida, and I was asked to give

           2   video testimony for that case, for the proceedings

           3   in Florida. That's the only one I can think of that

           4   was out

           5   Q.  of state. And over the 20 years, can you tell me

           6   the breakdown percentage of cases where you reviewed

           7   for the doctors and medical providers versus the

           8   injured patient,

           9   A.  both reviewed and Ultimately testified is by

          10   vast majority for defense

          11   Q.  is more than 75% probably 85%

          12   A.  I don't know. I mean 80% 85%

          13   Q.  and has that been, is that percentage stayed the

          14   same over the last 20 years, approximately?

          15   A.  Yeah, the reality situation is I, for some

          16   reason, I don't get asked to look at anything but

          17   defense work, so I don't get any plaintiff's work

          18   that come to my way, so it's just the way it is.

          19   Q.  And when's the last time you testified in court?

          20   If you can recall

          21   A.  in court several years ago, I can't be more

          22   precise.

          23   Q.  And of the four times that you've testified in

          24   court as an expert in medical malpractice cases. Do

          25   you recall the nature of the case and the opinion

                                                         7



           1   that you provided?

           2   A.  In general terms the last, the last case that I

           3   can recall testifying in court was pertaining to a

           4   alleged malpractice occurrence involved in a

           5   vascular injury in the knee area following Surgery.

           6   Do you

           7   Q.  remember any of the other ones? I

           8   A.  there was, there was another case that went to

           9   court. This goes back quite a few years. Similar

          10   scenario. This was a vascular injury in the knee

          11   area following arthroscopic surgery. Could not tell

          12   you the exact time or certainly not the names. There

          13   was a plaintiff's case that I became involved in

          14   that I testified in court on behalf of the plaintiff

          15   quite a few years ago that had to do with a with a

          16   foot injury.
