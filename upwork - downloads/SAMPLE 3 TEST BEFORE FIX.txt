        BEFORE YOU FIX BY DELETING EMPTY SPACES       1



           1   Q.

           2   Les, good afternoon. Doctor, could you please state

           3   your name and business address?

           4

           5   A.

           6   Yeah, my name is Leslie Scott Matthews and my

           7   business address is Department of orthopedic surgery

           8   at MedStar Union Memorial Hospital at 3333, North

           9   Calvert Street in Baltimore.

          10

          11   Q.

          12   Doctor, the reason that I've asked you to appear

          13   here today for your deposition is because the case

          14   that I represent Kevin Tolson with is pending in the

          15   circuit court for Baltimore City. The defendants

          16   have identified you as an expert. They may testify

          17   at trial, and I'm here to find out all the opinions

          18   that you intend to give in this case and all the

          19   factual basis for your opinions. And I presume

          20   you've had your deposition taken before I have okay.

          21   If at any time that I ask you a question that you

          22   don't understand, just stop me and ask me to

          23   rephrase the question. Otherwise, if you don't,

          24   we'll assume that you've understood the question and

          25   you've answered accordingly. Also, if any time you

                                                                           2



           1   need to take a break, just let us know and we'll

           2   stop the deposition.

           3

           4   A.

           5   Thank you, doctor.

           6

           7   Q.

           8   I want to show you what's been marked as exhibit

           9   number one. I number one. This is the notice that I

          10   sent to defense counsel noting your deposition

          11   today. Part of that notice contains a list of

          12   documents and items that we asked you to bring with

          13   you today. Do you have can you tell me what you

          14   brought with you today? In response to the

          15   deposition notice.

          16

          17   A.

          18   Yes, I have brought a copy of my curriculum vitae

          19   and all of the medical records and deposition

          20   testimony that pertains to this case that I've

          21   reviewed.

          22

          23   Q.

          24   Okay, can you, can you quickly go through and just

          25   identify each of the items that you have in front of

                                                                           3



           1   you that you brought with you today

           2

           3   A.

           4   will do my best. I guess it's better to begin here I

           5   have a compilation of files which include the

           6   medical records pertaining to Mr. Tolson's care.

           7   That include records from his initial visit to st

           8   Agnes on 12, 309, his follow up visit to st Agnes on

           9   12 509 and his subsequent care at the University of

          10   Maryland, which began, I believe, on 12 809 so

          11   that's a good portion of these records. I also have

          12   a significant number of transcripts of depositions

          13   given in this case, including and in no particular

          14   order, Caroline Stell, Krupa Shaw, Prudence Jackson,

          15   Dr David shank, Dr Timothy, Besant i Dr William

          16   Woodruff,

          17

          18   Dr Paul Collier I uh Jeffrey Nicholson's deposition,

          19   who is a PA Sharon Craddock, RN Corey, Elaine

          20   Tolson, Dr sarkar's deposition, Dr Malik's

          21   deposition, two volumes of depositions from Linda

          23   Sachs. CPO, a deposition of Kenneth Larson. MD, in

          24   addition, I have some CDs which represent the

          25   imaging studies that were done both at Mr. Colson's

                                                                           4



           1   initial presentation to st Agnes on 12 three and

           2   subsequently on his follow up there on 12 five, I

           3   also have two DVDs of animations that were prepared

           4   for this case that depict, or attempt to depict, his

           5   injury and mechanism of injury as I understand it.

           6   And then finally, there are just some

           7   correspondences that have taken place between myself

           8   and the other attorneys in this case.

           9

          10   Unknown Speaker

          11   Is, do you have the correspondence pulled out?

          12

          13   A.

          14   Well, it's here. Yes, it's sort of intermingled, but

          15   I'll

          16

          17   Q.

          18   just ask if at the end of the deposition, we can

          19   pull them out and then I can mark them as an

          20   exhibit. But we don't have to do that right now. We

          21   can

          22

          23   A.

          24   do whatever is best for you. Okay, I believe that

          25   covers everything.

                                                                           5



           1

           2   Q.

           3   Doctor Did you. I didn't hear you say that you

           4   reviewed an MRI study that was taken at university.

           5   University of Maryland hospital on December the

           6   ninth. Do you know, if you review, I

           7

           8   A.

           9   certainly saw a written report describing the

          10   findings. I can't recall. Quite honestly, I've

          11   actually saw the images or not.

          12

          13   Q.

          14   Okay. Did you need to see the actual images for any

          15   of the opinions that you intend to give in this

          16   case, or did you rely upon the written report itself

          17   that

          18

          19   A.

          20   had no not seeing the images when I have any bearing

          21   on many of my opinions, I don't believe okay.

          22

          23   Q.

          24   And did you prepare any notes? I did not. And have

          25   you made any notations in any of the records that

                                                                           6



           1   are that you brought with you today. I have not

           2   okay, and Doctor, can you tell me when you were

           3   first contacted to serve as an expert witness in

           4   this case?

           5

           6   A.

           7   Roughly sometime before the first of the year, I

           8   think in the month of December of 2013

           9

          10   Q.

          11   if I'm not mistaken, and which attorney contacted

          12   you, I believe

          13

          14   A.

          15   Miss Dinsmore, okay.

          16

          17   Q.

          18   Have you worked for MS Dinsmore or her firm before?

          19

          20   A.

          21   Not that I not with MS Dinsmore that I can recall,

          22   and I don't believe with her from

          23

          24   Q.

          25   okay. Do you know how MS Dinsmore knew about you or

                                                                           7



           1   I got Okay, all right. And doctor, you're serving

           2   today as an expert witness in a medical malpractice

           3   case. Have you ever served as an expert witness in a

           4   medical malpractice case before this case? I have.

           5   And can you tell me when you first started reviewing

           6   cases with an eye towards serving as an expert

           7   witness in medical malpractice matters?

           8

           9   A.

          10   I probably performed some sort of medical

          11   malpractice review or expert testimony over a period

          12   of at least 20 years. 20 years, yes,

          13

          14   Q.

          15   has it always been in the area of orthopedic

          16   surgery? It has. Do you hold yourself out as an

          17   expert in vascular surgery? I do not. Okay. And can

          18   you tell me, over the 20 years or so, how many times

          19   you've actually testified in court, either by

          20   videotape, deposition or in person?

          21

          22   A.

          23   Probably not more than four or five. Were they

          24

          25   Q.

                                                                           8



           1   in the state of Maryland, or were they? Were they

           2   all in the state of Maryland?

           3

           4   A.

           5   There was a case that I recall that took place in

           6   the state of Florida, and I was asked to give video

           7   testimony for that case, for the proceedings in

           8   Florida. That's the only one I can think of that was

           9   out

          10

          11   Q.

          12   of state. And over the 20 years, can you tell me the

          13   breakdown percentage of cases where you reviewed for

          14   the doctors and medical providers versus the injured

          15   patient,

          16

          17   A.

          18   both reviewed and Ultimately testified is by vast

          19   majority for defense

          20

          21   Q.

          22   is more than 75% probably 85%

          23

          24   A.

          25   I don't know. I mean 80% 85%

                                                                           9



           1

           2   Q.

           3   and has that been, is that percentage stayed the

           4   same over the last 20 years, approximately?

           5

           6   A.

           7   Yeah, the reality situation is I, for some reason, I

           8   don't get asked to look at anything but defense

           9   work, so I don't get any plaintiff's work that come

          10   to my way, so it's just the way it is.

          11

          12   Q.

          13   And when's the last time you testified in court? If

          14   you can recall

          15

          16   A.

          17   in court several years ago, I can't be more precise.

          18

          19   Q.

          20   And of the four times that you've testified in court

          21   as an expert in medical malpractice cases. Do you

          22   recall the nature of the case and the opinion that

          23   you provided?

          24

          25   A.

                                                                          10



           1   In general terms the last, the last case that I can

           2   recall testifying in court was pertaining to a

           3   alleged malpractice occurrence involved in a

           4   vascular injury in the knee area following Surgery.

           5   Do you

           6

           7   Q.

           8   remember any of the other ones? I

           9

          10   A.

          11   there was, there was another case that went to

          12   court. This goes back quite a few years. Similar

          13   scenario. This was a vascular injury in the knee

          14   area following arthroscopic surgery. Could not tell

          15   you the exact time or certainly not the names. There

          16   was a plaintiff's case that I became involved in

          17   that I testified in court on behalf of the plaintiff

          18   quite a few years ago that had to do with a with a

          19   foot injury.

          20

          21

          22

          23

          24
